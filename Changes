Version 1.16 - 29th December 2005
    + Added Changes file.

    + Modified Makefile.PL to send anonymous information to
      http://perlgirl.org.uk/lib/usage.cgi if the user
      agrees. This is so I can track which of my modules
      are most heavily used and on what platforms, so I can
      concentrate on maintaning the most popular ones in
      my limited spare time.
