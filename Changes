Version 1.19 - 7th January 2006
    + Added Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage
      unit tests.

Version 1.18 - 30th December 2005
    + Changed license to Apache 2.0
      http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

Version 1.16 - 29th December 2005
    + Added Changes file.

    + Modified Makefile.PL to send anonymous information to
      http://perlgirl.org.uk/lib/usage.cgi if the user
      agrees. This is so I can track which of my modules
      are most heavily used and on what platforms, so I can
      concentrate on maintaning the most popular ones in
      my limited spare time.
